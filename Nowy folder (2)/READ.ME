 AUSTRALIA NEWS

 An  Australian,  Mr.   Anthony  C  Harvey,  is  selling
 counterfeit copies of our software.

 He  has advertised  using  our  company name.   He  has
 printed labels  and manuals duplicating  the appearance
 of our  products, and  he has  negotiated cheques  made
 payable to Quaid  Software Ltd.  We are  pursuing civil
 and criminal remedies against Mr.  Anthony C Harvey.

 Customers in  possession of  counterfeit copies  of our
 software  obtained  from  Mr.    Anthony  C  Harvey  or
 Aardvark Utilities should request a refund from:

                Mr. Anthony C Harvey,  c/o
                Aardvark Utilities,
                PO Box 514, Hawthorn 3122

 It is possible  he has changed his  address and company
 name.


 UNGUARD AND EVERLOCK.

 Starting with  the November 1988 edition  the "Unguard"
 utility  now  unprotects  diskettes  protected  by  the
 Everlock copy protection system by AZ-TECH up to version 1.94

 Starting with  the May 1990 edition  the "Rescue"
 utility  now  handles diskettes  protected  by  the
 Everlock copy protection system by AZ-TECH up to version 2.02

 Rescue was  developed to  remove copy  protection.  For
 those familiar with the Unguard utility, Rescue is used
 the same way.  Instructions on  the use of "Rescue" are
 listed below.

 RESCUE AND TWO FLOPPY DISKETTE DRIVE SYSTEMS.

 For  two  drive  systems you  will  need  the  original
 program diskette,  and a blank formatted  diskette that
 will be referred to as the Rescued backup diskette.

 þ  PUT A WRITE PROTECT TAB ON YOUR ORIGINAL DISKETTE.

 þ  Insert your  CopyWrite diskette  into Drive  A:, and
    the Rescued backup diskette into drive B:.

 þ  To start the Rescue program,  at the DOS prompt type
    "a:rescue" [enter].  Once Rescue  has loaded, remove
    your CopyWrite  diskette from drive A:,  and replace
    it with the program diskette.

 þ  The  cursor  will  point  to  the  function  "Source
    drive".  If the  Source drive is NOT set  to a:, use
    the [+] [-] keys to change it to a:.

 þ  Using the  cursor down  key move  the cursor  to the
    function  "Source  product", and  enter  the  source
    product  name  from  the  list  included  with  your
    CopyWrite package.

 þ  Using the  cursor down  key move  the cursor  to the
    function "Target drive".  Using the  [+] or [-] keys
    change the target drive to b:.

 þ  Using the  cursor down  key move  the cursor  to the
    function "Strip copy protection" and press the enter
    key.

 As Rescue processes the copy protected program, it will
 display the files it reads  from the original diskette,
 and writes to the target.

 A successful Rescue will report:
      Success.
      I have stripped the copy protection.
      Press any key to proceed.


 RESCUE FOR A SINGLE FLOPPY DRIVE AND A HARD DRIVE.

 For  this type  of system  it is  recommended that  you
 create a separate subdirectory for the package you want
 to Rescue.   These instructions  make two  assumptions,
 first that your hard drive is  c:, and secondly you are
 not currently running the program  from your hard drive
 already.

 þ  Create the subdirectory your  program will be loaded
    into using  the DOS command  mkdir.  If  you already
    have a subdirectory for your program skip this step.

 þ  Change to the subdirectory your program will be loaded
    into using the DOS command chdir.

 þ  Insert your  CopyWrite diskette  into Drive  A:.

 þ  To start the Rescue program,  at the DOS prompt type
    "a:rescue" [enter].  Once Rescue  has loaded, remove
    your CopyWrite  diskette from drive A:,  and replace
    it with the program diskette.

 þ  The  cursor  will  point  to  the  function  "Source
    drive".  If the  Source drive is NOT set  to a:, use
    the [+] [-] keys to change it to a:

 þ  Using the  cursor down key  move  the cursor  to the
    function  "Source  product", and  enter  the  source
    product  name  from  the   list  in  your  CopyWrite
    package.

 þ  Using the  cursor down key  move  the cursor  to the
    function "Target drive".  Using the  [+] or [-] keys
    change the target drive to c:

 þ  Using the  cursor down key  move  the cursor  to the
    function "Strip copy protection" and press the enter
    key.

 As Rescue processes the copy protected program, it will
 display the files it reads  from the original diskette,
 and writes to the target.

 A successful Rescue will report:
      Success.
      I have stripped the copy protection .
      Press any key to proceed.



 CopyWrite supports  all of the  IBM PS/2  models except
 those with a speed of 33 Mhz, as well as the Tandy 1000
 computers (EX, SX, HX, and TX)  having a DMA chip ( the
 DMA chip comes with the memory expansion boards), using
 both 5.25"  diskettes, and  3.5" diskettes.   CopyWrite
 will support 3.5" diskettes on  machines other than the
 PS/2 provided their drive designation  is either A:  or
 B:  (this  is required  because CopyWrite  needs direct
 access  to the  floppy  drive  controller card).   This
 means  CopyWrite cannot  support  3.5" diskette  drives
 that  require   device  drivers  to  be   loaded  (i.e.
 driver.sys that comes with DOS 3.2 and later).

 Since many  software publishers have abandoned  the use
 of copy protection, there is less requirement to revise
 CopyWrite.   We  no  longer  do   so  monthly,  but  at
 irregular intervals  as changes  in technology  or copy
 protection require.

HARDWARE SUPPORTED
 CopyWrite  is   100%  compatible  with   the  following
 computers:

     Compaq Portable and Deskpro
     Compaq Portable 286 and Deskpro 286
     Compaq Portable I and II
     IBM PC, PC XT, and PC AT
     IBM PS/2 model 30, 50, 60, 80, 50z, 55, 70
                ( but not 33 Mhz machines )
     Micronics 80386 20Mhz
     Sperry PC
     Tandy 1000 EX, SX, HX, TX with DMA chips
     Tandy 1200
     Toshiba T3100
     Zenith Z-150 and Z-160

 We have had  reports that CopyWrite is  also compatible
 with the following  computers.  However, if there  is a
 problem with  CopyWrite on  these computers  we may  be
 unable to duplicate the problem in order to correct it.
 We will  do our best to  solve any problems  with these
 computers:

         AT&T 6300 (will not run Prolok disks)
         Columbia
         Corona
         Eagle (later models only)
         Kaypro PC
         Leading Edge PC
         NEC APC4
         Olivetti M24 (will not run Prolok disks)
         Panasonic Sr. Partner
         Sequa
         Tandy 3000
         Tava PC
         Vectra HP

 Any computer  not listed  above may  not be  compatible
 with  CopyWrite.   Machines that  have  an  Accelerator
 board  are  most likely  incompatible  with  CopyWrite.
 CopyWrite will not copy high density diskettes.  If you
 have a  computer not  listed above  and you  have found
 that  CopyWrite  runs  without problems  on  it  please
 contact  us with  the make  and  model so  that we  can
 inform other customers of its compatiblity.  Thank you.

CORRECTIONS TO THE MANUAL
 Fastback and  Concentric Information  Processor are  no
 longer  supported.   Also,  dBase III  version  1.1  is
 backed up  using UnGuard only  and not  using CopyWrite
 and loading Ramkey into memory first.

SOFTWARE LIST
 With this edition  of CopyWrite, you should  be able to
 backup your  Prolok 2 and Everlock  protected software.
 To  backup Prolok  2 protected  software you  do it  by
 using  CopyWrite and  then loading  Ramkey into  memory
 before using the backup, or by using UnGuard on each of
 the  .exe files  on  the  program disk.   For  Everlock
 protected software use CopyWrite or Unguard or Rescue.

 Consult  the manual  for  the  full list  of  supported
 programs.   Additions to  the software  list are  shown
 below.

CopyWrite contains generic routines for removing copy protection
from the following schemes:

  þ Creates an unprotected version of the Everlock protected file that was
    specified to Unguard.
  þ Works on the hard drive installed form of Everlock protection.
  þ Works on stand-alone diskettes.
  þ Does NOT work if the protected software makes a protection check after
    the software was initially loaded.

Everlock   by AZ-Tech     Rescue        All versions up to 2.02
  þ Later versions may also be handled.
  þ Creates a new version of the Everlock protected file that was
    specified to Rescue, and creates some SYS files to hold the Everlock
    special data.  These SYS files must be present in the default
    sub-directory, to run the new file that Rescue created.
  þ Works on the hard drive installed form of Everlock protection.
  þ Does NOT work on stand-alone diskettes.
  þ Does work for protection checks made by the protected software after the
    software was initially loaded.

  þ Instructions for unprotecting Everlock with Rescue.
    (1)  Install the Everlock protected software to your hard drive.
         Change to the sub-directory that holds this protected software.
    (2)  Run Rescue with Source drive C:  (must be the hard drive)
                         Source product:  EVEROPEN
                         Target drive A:  (usually a floppy)
                  Strip copy protection:  (hit Enter)
    (3)  Rescue will then ask for the protected filename.  This is the
         main executable file of the protected software. It must have
         an extension of COM or EXE.  Answer the question and hit Enter.
    (4)  Rescue will create a new version of the Everlock protected file
         and some SYS files on the target drive.
    (5)  Uninstall or recall the Everlock protected software from your
         hard drive.
    (6)  Rename the protected filename on your hard drive to something else.
    (7)  Copy all the files that Rescue created on the target drive, to
         your hard drive.

                           copy of the diskette.

Cogo v4.12L by CivilSoft   must use dos assign a=c prior to running.

Micro TSP v6.0
 When unprotecting  this program using  a hard  disk make
 sure you copy the 'install' diskette, 'disk 1', and then
 'disk 2' onto your hard disk  in that order.  Delete the
 file  'tsp.exe' from  you hard  disk.   Run the  unguard
 program using 'tsp.exe' as the source file.

Novell Netware v2.11
 This product uses both SuperLok copy protection and some
 protection of  their own.   Start by  making yourself  a
 backup  copy   of  the  "gendata"  diskette   using  the
 CopyWrite  program.  Delete  the  file getdata.com  from
 your  CopyWrite   backup.   Run   "Unguard"  using   the
 "gendata"   diskette  as   the   source  diskette,   and
 "getdata.com" as the source file.  Unguard will create a
 file called "getdata.com", and  "getdata.qxe" copy these
 files  onto  your  CopyWrite  backup  of  the  "gendata"
 diskette.   Once  you  have used  the  CopyWrite  backup
 diskette  to install  the Novell  Netware the  CopyWrite
 backup diskette  will no longer  work.  You may  want to
 make yourself a working archive again.

Alpine Encounter
 Is a "flippy  disk".  In order to make  a backup using
 CopyWrite, you need  to set the number  of sides option
 to 1.  Then make a backup  of one side of the original
 diskette to a  blank diskette.  When that  is done turn
 over the original diskette to side 2 and make a backup
 of that side to another blank diskette.  In the end you
 will have  two diskettes as  backups for  the original
 one "flippy diskette".   Be sure to label  each backup
 diskette so that you know which  is Side 1 and which is
 Side 2.

Amnesia
 If you are  just making a backup of  the original disk,
 then you  need to  use SoloBoot to  run the  backup you
 make.   If  you  use  the install  that  comes  on  the
 original Amnesia program  disk then you can  use Ramkey
 to run it from the hard drive after you install it.


Backgammon 5.0
 At the end of the  CopyWrite procedure you will receive
 the message "Abort, Retry, or Ignore?".  Select the "A"
 for abort  and that  will bring you  back to  DOS.  The
 copy you made will run like the original.  Just reboot
 your system to load it.

Crossword Magic
 At the end of the  CopyWrite procedure you will receive
 the message  "sector not  found error  reading drive...
 Abort,  Retry, Ignore?".   Choose  the  "I" to  ignore.
 This will return  you to the CopyWrite  menu.  Now exit
 to DOS.   The backup CopyWrite  made is good  and will
 run like the original.

Disk Optimizer v1.4
 Before using UnGuard  to make your backup,  use DOS and
 copy all the files from the original disk to the target
 disk.  Then  delete optimize.com from the  target disk.
 Now run  UnGuard.  Instead  of creating  one new  file,
 UnGuard   will   create   optimize.qxe    and   a   new
 optimize.com.

Microreality   V2.0 rev.  B
 You should read the Special Case section of the printed
 manual under the ".Com and  .Exe Files" heading.  Those
 notes apply to this program as well.

Colonel's Bequest  by Sierra.
 Press <Enter> at the fingerprint screen.  Do not click
 mouse or joystick button.

LITIGATION
 Vault Corporation emerged from  bankruptcy on March 24,
 1988.  The appeal  of Vault Corporation from  the trial
 court  decision mentioned  in  the  printed manual  was
 decided by the  appeals court in our favor  on June 21,
 1988.  Short  of an appeal  to the Supreme  Court, this
 will  probably end  the litigation  on  the subject  of
 making backup copies  of computer software.  As  it now
 stands, there is no legal barrier to the sale or use of
 CopyWrite, as long as it is used for backup purposes.

Disk  Explorer recovers  accidentally  deleted
files and directories automatically!

Every  computer user  will  one  day know  the
sinking   feeling  that   follows   accidental
deletion of a file, program or directory.

What many people don't know however is that as
long as nothing  has been written to  the disk
since the deletion,  the data is still  on the
diskette.  In these circumstances, recovery is
possible and Disk Explorer will do it quickly.

For  the   more  technically   inclined,  Disk
Explorer will  also let you see  what's really
on your disk, view  and change formats, change
the  status  of  files,  change  data  in  any
sector, correct bad tracks and much more.

Disk Explorer, the program every computer user
should have, just in case is available for $75
US.
